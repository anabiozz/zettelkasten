A logistic system is a system which controls and enables the realization of “flow” of materials, information and finance.

Logistic objects (as a philosophy of management) are the flows (as substance changing its parameter in time and place). These objects are complex and dynamic systems. If we wish to control them, we need to know them – analyze and model.

Flow as moving substance changing its parameters in time and place, is created as a distinction of potentials. We can explain it analogically by an example of electric field. Electric current results from the interconnection of higher potential (+) with lower potential. Logistics creates conditions for flow establishment, manages them and ensures them.

1.  Europe and North America upraise approximately only half of raw materials they need for their industry production. That is the reason they need to import the materials.
    
2.  Russia is dealing with the opposite situation. They upraise almost twice that much of raw materials then they are able to use in their industry production. Asia, Australia and Oceania upraise also almost one third more then they use.

3. On the other hand, Europe and North America and their industry produce much more products and technologies then their market can consume. That is the reason they need to export their products mostly to Asia, Africa, Russia, South America etc. On the we can see the main three material flows. Above each of them, there is a triplet R/P/C

-  R/P – proportion of production and consumption of raw materials.
    
- C – share of world‟s consumption of goods rising from proportion of population to worlds‟ population.
    
-   Together with material flow, there are parallel and inverse flows of information and finance are created.

If we take a look at the 20th century, economical dynamic was always influenced by different factors:
 
- 50s – 60s of 20th century is also called production oriented economy, which focused on maximizing of production. Main issue was to produce as much  as possible. Successful companies were those which could produce the most possible amount.
- 50s – 70s were mostly oriented on sale – maximizing of sale. Production has exceeded the demand; old markets were totally covered by products. Successful companies were those which could sell as much as possible.
-  70s – 90s are known for their marketing orientation. The aim was to maximize the area of trade. Customers started to be more essential, battles for new markets was common. Research and companies are more interested in marketing strategies. More and more companies base on long-term contracts, strategic customers and trades.
- Last years of 20th century – logistic oriented economy focused on maximal satisfaction of customers. The whole chain of company‟s activities is oriented on global costs reduction and on final customer.

Internal logistics of a company operational level is called the micro-logistics. Inside of it the individual machines, activities and processes are viewed as black boxes.

Higher level, where company as a whole is a part of a higher system (for example logistic chain of companies or logistic network) is called macro-logistics.

If we are not able to sufficiently manage flows and chains within company on the micro level, we would need to decompose the system and take a look at the lower level on elementary operations which are carried out within individual machines, aggregates, robotic processes on the level of nano-logistics.

On each of these three levels, there are several operations carried out according their significant characteristics, outputs, time and so on. But actual internal view consists of three basic processes:

- transformation – (processing operation, installation, connection) where quantitative and qualitative parameters of substance αKV, αQ are changed.

- transportation – movement carried out by transport, manipulation, where position parameters are changed αX.

- cumulation – assembling, collecting, where parameter of time is changed αt and other parameters are not changed αKV, αQ, αX.

To define the logistic system means to define its structure, functions, activities, aims... We can view the logistic system from technical and functional side.

From the technical view, elements of the systems are the facilities and tools ensuring and executing the movement – flow in time and place, as for example cars, ships, trains, transportation bells, conveyers, warehousing equipments, chain bells, robots, production lines and machines, etc. When talking about material flows, in that case there are terminals, computers, computer networks, modems, satellite and transmission equipments, etc. When talking about information flows, there are connection to material, information and financial flows.

From the functional point of new – activity point of view, we are talking about allocation, placement, organization, management and coordination of movement of materials, products, information and finance. Important activities like allocation and lay-out of a company, production equipments and machines, warehouses, distribution centres, sales, prognosis and strategic planning of sales, production, purchase and storage, selection of products and services suppliers, what amount to buy, shat system of transport to use, what are supposed to be the designed at input, inter-operation and output warehouses and clusters, what is going to be the optimal production dose, if to use the capacity for 100% and risk that way or if there should be still a resist and that way keep ourselves ready to accept new orders, how to prepare operative plan, in what sequence to produce products, where is going to be the acceptance place between the producer and customer, what system of financing to use, etc.

(a) Management is a total control of a company, firm, production, sales, human resources, finance and others through economic parameters like profit, costs, yields, cash flow, productivity, etc. The criteria of management and optimization are of economical character.

(b)Logistics – management of flows and process chains through time, sequential, layer and capacity parameters like capacity usability of equipments, order and amount of produced product, layout of sale and distribution centres, initiate time, processing time and finalizing time of individual processes. Criteria of management are capacitive, time, but in global explanation they are economic. Processes creating chains are purchasing, procurement, storing, transport, production processes, distribution of products, maintenance, etc. managing functions are allocated, layout and set-up, prognosis, aggregation planning, scheduling, dispatching control, monitoring and others.

(c) Control – process management controls of magnitudes physical, mechanical, thermal chemical, etc. like temperature in furnace, compressive force of cylinders, size of engine evolve, level size, etc. Criteria of optimizing are also from the area of technical parameters but at the end they are economic.

Among these activities and decisions, following belongs:
1. Allocation of company.
2. Commodities strategy.
3. Organization of production processes.
4. Production strategy.
5. Organization of company – organization structure.
6. Capacity strategy and determination of marrow place. 7. Structure and parameters of planning systems.
8. Distribution and procurement network.

Allocation is influenced by following factors: – production:
- raw material resources. 
- energy availability.
-  transportation possibilities.
- work force and its classification.

Trade:

- taxation level.  
- market.  
- communication possibilities.
- price, etc.

Social:  
- unemployment.
- production traditions, etc. 

Allocation methods base on:

(a) Multi-criteria decisions if factors are difficult to quantify, or. 
(b) Solution of geometric task.


## The Commodities Strategy.

Position of various product selections of a company on the life curve is important for estimation of long-term perspective and stability of that particular company. Position of products on life curve means the amount of product in the phases of development, growth, peak or regress.

## The Production Strategy.
1. Order production is carried out by PULL system based on JIT, meaning produced on certain date according to the order (Due date). From the last operation, finishing times of other operations are calculated. PULL system is carried out by KANBAN method, created by Toyota Motor Company in year 1960.
2. The opposed strategy - PUSH (production for storage). Products are planned from the beginning, meaning from the first operation till the last one in technological sequences. A border-line situation could happen in MEPII principle, when at the same time several products are started to be produced and later connected together, assemble into configurations and final products
3. Advantage of PUSH system is the possibility of production optimization. Larger production batches, independency of production on demand, time delivery, shorter delivery times, etc. PULL strategy minimizes the storage, lower the risk of deployment of product on market, etc
4. Connection of these two strategies JIT and MRP II (PULL and PUSH) is merging advantages of both of them. The first company, which implemented this combination, was Yamaha Motor Company in 1970 as Synchro MRP
