People don’t use a computer to enjoy the operating system; they don’t care about setting their system preferences, nor do they care about choosing what kind of scrollbars they want. They use a computer because they want to create something; they want to communicate with somebody; they want to express their own personality, everything from writing a novel to balancing their checkbook – some more fun than others, but it’s all about accomplishing something that really doesn’t have anything to do wtih using a computer. The computer is just a tool.
