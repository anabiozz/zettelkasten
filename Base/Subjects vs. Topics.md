A _subject_ of a research paper is the general content. Subjects are broad and general. For example:

-   Health
-   Television
-   Stocks and bonds
-   Travel

The _topic_ of a research paper, in contrast, is the specific issue being discussed. Here are some possible _topics_ for a research paper developed from the previous subjects:

-   **Health**  
    assessing fad diets  
    arguing the merits of AIDS testing of health care workers
-   **Television**  
    arguing for or against the V-chip in televisions  
    taking a side in the cable wars
-   **Stocks and bonds**  
    showing that day trading is profitable (or not)  
    persuading readers to use e-trades rather than brokers (or vice versa)
-   **Travel**  
    arguing that surcharges for solo travelers are unfair  
    arguing the merits of e-tickets

Consider all facets of your subject as you develop topics. You may wish to speak to other people about the subject or just let your mind free-associate. Let those ideas bubble up!

### Cut Down to Size

To get that beast of a subject tailored to an appropriate size, try phrasing the subject as a question. You can also list subdivisions of the subject to create topics. Can't find subtopics? Consult card catalogues, reference books, and textbooks for ideas.
