## What Is Shipping?

There are two main definitions of [shipping when it comes to logistics](https://www.apsfulfillment.com/product-fulfillment-services/shipping-fulfillment/). The first definition speaks to the **size of the package**. Smaller objects, such as shoes, clothes, and accessories, can fall under the category of shipping since they can be boxed and sent to the customer using a postal service. The second definition refers to when items are required to be sent to customers. As such, consumers can understand the shipping date to be the day on which the item was dispatched and began making its way to them.

## What Is Delivery?

Delivery often refers to larger objects, like major appliances and furniture, which require installation or a delivery person to fetch it inside your home—items that need to be delivered are usually too big to be shipped. Delivery is also the term used to refer to the date on which the package will arrive at the customer’s doorstep. However, this date is usually a general estimate since it’s uncontrollable by the vendor and can be delayed by unforeseen circumstances.

## Shipping vs. Delivery: What’s the Difference?

Overall, there are two main **differences between shipping and delivery**. The first being the size: smaller items are shipped while larger items are delivered. The second difference is the date on which each takes place. Shipping dates usually refer to when an item leaves the [warehouse](https://www.apsfulfillment.com/product-fulfillment-services/warehousing-solutions/) while the delivery date specifies when it should reach the customer.
